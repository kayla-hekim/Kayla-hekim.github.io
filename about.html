            <p>Hello everyone, my name is Kayla Kim, and I'm an aspiring data scientist and software engineer. My passion for programming began in fifth grade when I attended a camp to code Minecraft mods. Since then, this passion has extended from sandbox video games to developing apps and analyzing incoming data with various languages, including java, python, and more. To see the fruits of my work, I recommend checking out my Projects tab! There, you'll also find links to my LinkedIn and GitHub. <br><br> The reason my passion was able to expand this far is because I'm an avid learner. I absolutely love watching experts in the field do their work, and adapting the lessons into my professional life. Contact me if you're interested in learning more!</p>
